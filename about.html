Headshot of Me 


Professional
I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan's School of Information pursuing a degree in user experience design as well as data informatics and analytics. I have a love for marketing, design, communications and the arts and I am extremely passionate about social impact. I want to pursue a career where I can merge these passions and truly innovate on current world problems.

Casual
I love music, spontaneous adventures, and hanging out with my friends. When I have free time, I can either be found at a concert, hiking, exploring museums, or searching for new places to get food!

Ever since I was a kid I have had a passion for photography. Since then, in my free time I have expanded my passions to drawing, graphic design, and videography. I also have a photography portfolio that showcases some of my photos!
